We
regularly
monitor
water
quality
in
all
major
urban
centres
in
this
State.
During
1995
-
96,
we
found
that
9,730
out
of
159,233
samples
of
water
were
contaminated
with
disease
causing
organisms,
representing
a
high
6.11
per
cent
of
the
total
number
of
samples
collected
and
analysed.
This
is
an
alarmingly
high
level
of
contamination
considering
that
Maharashtra
is
one
of
the
more
developed
states
in
India
and
it
may
be
higher
in
other
states.
Also
during
late
summer
months
when
there
is
water
scarcity,
and
during
the
monsoon
season,
contamination
of
drinking
water
is
very
high.
Hence
during
these
months
it
is
doubly
important
to
ensure
drinking
water
is
adequately
sanitised."
